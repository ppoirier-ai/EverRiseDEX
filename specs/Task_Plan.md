# EverRiseDEX Development Task Plan

## Project Overview
EverRiseDEX is a decentralized exchange built on Solana that implements a unique bonding curve mechanism with perpetual upward price momentum. The system uses a combination of bonding curve pricing, peer-to-peer queue matching, and daily minimum growth guarantees.

## Specification Review & Reconciliation

### Identified Inconsistencies
1. **Stablecoin Reference**: Technical Specs uses "USDC" while Formula doc uses "USDT"
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize on USDC as it's more widely adopted on Solana
2. **Formula Formatting**: Technical Specs has broken LaTeX images, Formula doc has proper LaTeX
   - **Recommendation**: Use the clean LaTeX formatting from Formula doc

### Resolved Specifications
- **Initial X (Reserve)**: 100,000 USDC
- **Initial Y (Token Supply)**: 1,000,000,000 EVER tokens
- **Daily Minimum Growth**: 0.02% (0.0002)
- **Queue Bonus Factor**: 0.1% (0.001)
- **Price Formula**: P(Y) = [X/Y + Î£[(0.001 Ã— V) / ((X/Y) Ã— SC)]] Ã— (1 + DailyBoost)

## Technical Considerations

### Solana-Specific Requirements
- **Account Size Limits**: Design efficient data structures for bonus history storage
- **Compute Unit Limits**: Optimize calculations to stay within transaction limits
- **Rent Exemption**: Ensure all accounts maintain rent-exempt status
- **Program Upgrades**: Plan for future upgrades while maintaining state

### Security Measures
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **Overflow Protection**: Use checked arithmetic for all calculations
- **Access Control**: Implement proper authority checks for admin functions
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Prevent reentrancy attacks in transaction processing

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Operations**: Group related operations to minimize transaction costs
- **Storage Efficiency**: Use packed data structures to minimize account sizes
- **Calculation Caching**: Cache expensive calculations where possible
- **Queue Optimization**: Efficient queue management for high-volume scenarios

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Mathematical Precision**: Use fixed-point arithmetic to avoid floating-point errors
- **Storage Limits**: Implement efficient data structures and cleanup mechanisms
- **Gas Optimization**: Profile and optimize compute unit usage

### Economic Risks
- **Price Manipulation**: Implement safeguards against large transaction manipulation
- **Queue Backlog**: Design treasury buyback mechanisms to prevent excessive backlogs
- **Growth Sustainability**: Monitor and adjust parameters based on real-world usage

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Transaction processing time < 1 second
- 99.9% uptime on Solana network
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- All price calculations accurate to 8 decimal places

### Economic Metrics
- Daily minimum growth consistently achieved
- Queue processing time < 24 hours under normal conditions
- Treasury efficiency > 95% for buyback operations
- User transaction success rate > 99%

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED (Priority Fix Required)

### **Race Condition & Transaction Safety Issues**
1. **Missing Buy Queue System**
   - Current implementation processes buys immediately without queuing
   - Risk of concurrent transactions interfering with each other
   - No atomic price locking mechanism
   - Potential for users to lose USDC on failed transactions

2. **Price Calculation Inconsistencies**
   - Price reconstructed from scratch each time (no stored state)
   - Missing cumulative bonus tracking implementation
   - No daily boost state persistence
   - Volume-weighted appreciation formula not properly implemented

3. **Queue Processing Logic Missing**
   - `process_sell_queue` function referenced but not implemented
   - No peer-to-peer matching mechanism
   - No appreciation bonus calculation for queue-based buys

### **Implementation Gaps**
- **Buy Queue**: No FIFO ordering for buy transactions
- **Price Storage**: No persistent price state with cumulative bonuses
- **Transaction Atomicity**: No protection against mid-transaction price changes
